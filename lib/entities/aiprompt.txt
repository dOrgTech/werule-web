make a flutter widget which is a wizard to help users set up a DAO. It will consist of a few several screens:


Screen 1
Title: "Select DAO type"
two side by side 300x300 clickable areas, each with:
    - a placeholder for an image
    - a Title
    - a short description
    Option 1 Title: "On-chain"
    Option 2 Title: "Off-chain"
    use some "lorem ipsum" text for the description for now, but keep it under 150 characters.


Screen 2.
here we have the following fields:
    - "DAO Name" (text input, max. characters 80)
    - "DAO Description" (text input, 4 lines tall, max characters 400)
    - "Token Symbol" (text input, max characters 5)
    - "Number of decimals" (text input, only numbers, between 0 and 18)
    - "Non-transferrable" (checkbox)

Screen 3. 
more fields, but these will each have a short description attached:
    - Quorum Threshold (Slider, goes between 0 and 99)
        desc: "Minimum participation required for a proposal to pass"
    - Voting Duration (custom element for selecting duration with componenets in the same horizontal row:
        - text input, only numbers, maximum characters 2
        - text: "days"
        - text input, only numbers, maximum characters 2
        - text: "hours"
        - text input, only numbers, maximum characters 2
        - text: "minutes"
        )
        desc: How long a proposal will be open for voting
    - Voting Delay (same custom element described above for voting duration)

Screen 4.
this will have some logic that dynamically changes the state. It is where the initial members of the DAO are added.
We have the following items:
    - "Total Tokens: 0" (it starts with zero but will be dynamically updated)
then a section where we add the members using two fields for each new member:
    - "Member Address" (text input, 42 characters)
    - "Amount" (text input, only positive non-fractional numbers)
    Below there is a button to add a new member, and if clicked it introduces a new set of fields below to add a new member
    The `Total Tokens` value is updated based on all the amounts of the members added.


On the left side of each screen there is a widget that shows an overview of the entire wizard, indicating the current step. The names of the screens used here are: 1 "DAO Type", 2 "Basic Setup", 3 "Durations", 4 "Members". This allows the user to click on any of the sections in the wizard and go back to that section (only if they are on a section further)
There are also "Next" and "Back" buttons on all the screens.

Make sure to use configuration objects to store the values provided by the user. You can pick the most efficient or your preferred way to implement this, but I would suggest using separate widgets for each of the screens.
